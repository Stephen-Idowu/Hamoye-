Learning Data Science and Data Analysis has always been intriguing to me.
During the internship I had the opportunity to Learn about Python, Git, and Machine Learning. 
Had the chance to learn about new concept that arent familiar to me. 
As a newbie in the field. I had to document my learning.
In other to alaways make reference to it.
