Learning Data Science and Data Analysis have always been intriguing to me.
During the internship, I had the opportunity to learn about Python, Git, and Machine Learning. 
Had the chance to learn about new concepts that arent familiar to me. 
As a newbie in the field. I had to document my learning.
In other to ever refer to it.
